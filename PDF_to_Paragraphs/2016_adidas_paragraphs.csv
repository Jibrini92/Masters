"Our long-term business strategy Creating the New is 
based on the core belief that, through sport, we have 
the power to change lives. And we do this every day as 
a company: by empowering people to live an active life, 
by teaching life skills through sport and by creating 
sustainable products. Our core belief becomes 
particularly relevant when we talk about the impact 
we have with our sustainability work. We are one of 
the very few companies that integrate sustainability 
into their business model, which is most visible in the 
fact that we take sustainability to the product level. 
Two examples are our products made of Parley Ocean 
Plastic and the ever-increasing amount of Better 
Cotton used in our products. Our UltraBOOST Uncaged 
Parley was the best-selling shoe in our newly opened 
store on 5th Avenue in New York upon its launch. Also 
in 2016, we exceeded our target to source 60% Better 
Cotton by 8 percentage points, which puts us in a good 
position to source 100% of our cotton as sustainable 
cotton by the end of 2018. But we do not stop there. We 
do not only see sustainability as an opportunity to get 
a competitive advantage. We see it as an obligation for 
us as a global company to do business in a responsible 
and sustainable way.

"WE SEE IT AS AN  
 
OBLIGATION FOR  
 
US AS A GLOBAL  
COMPANY TO DO  
BUSINESS IN A  
RESPONSIBLE AND  
SUSTAINABLE WAY.
",4
"In this context, 2016 saw the kick-off of 
the most holistic sustainability strat-
egy of adidas to date because it looks at 
the entire life cycle of sport. This makes 
our sustainability strategy so powerful 
and successful. Research we conducted 
shows that consumers, the creator gen-
eration, see sport as an essential part of 
their life, and they would dislike a world 
without spaces allowing them to prac-
tise sports. Sport needs a space to exist. 
However, these spaces are increasingly 
endangered due to various threats to our 
world such as increased industrial pol-
lution and its effect on the environment 
and our planets climate, the violation 
of human rights such as forced labour 
practices or discrimination, the conse-
quences of increasing urbanisation as 
well as the ever-growing population, to 
name a few examples. 
",5
"Based on our passion for sport, we want 
to be the guardians of these spaces of 
sport, and we aim to protect these spaces 
that have a direct link to our business: 
we want to protect spaces where sport 
is made, sold and played. Within this life 
cycle of sport, we focus on two dimen-
sions, people and product, for each of 
which we have set three strategic prior-
ities and ambitious, tangible and meas-
urable goals that guide our sustainability 
work towards 2020. You will find more 
details on these priorities, and the pro-
gress we made towards these goals in 
2016, as you read this report.
",5
"We are proud that we are 
seen as being honestly com-
mitted to sustainability and 
as a leader in our industry. 
This is reflected in our con-
tinued inclusion in some of 
the most important global 
sustainability indices. One 
example is our membership 
in the Dow Jones Sustain-
ability Indices, where we have 
been listed for 17 consecu-
tive years. In 2016, as one of 
the top-scoring companies in 
our industry, adidas received 
the RobecoSAM Gold Class 
and Industry Mover distinc-
tion for excellent sustainabil-
ity performance.

"Our focus on sustainability is not only recognised by investors, 
experts and consumers. It also excites our 60,000 employees 
and is a major reason why young people from all over the world 
would like to work for us. They want to be part of a company 
that has a clear mission. Our mission is to be the best sports 
company in the world. Best means that we design, build and 
sell the best sports and fitness products in the world, with the 
best service and experience, and in a sustainable way. Best

RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE ENTIRE
 
LIFE CYCLE OF
SPORT:

"We believe that through sport, we have the power to change 
lives. It is what drives us and stands behind everything we do. 
It is also the core of our Sustainability Strategy Sport needs 
a space, which was introduced in 2016. Building on existing 
programmes and tackling the subjects most material to our 
business and stakeholders, its name says it all: for sport to be 
able to change lives, it needs a space to exist such as a field 
to play on or a mountain to climb. The reality is, however, that 
due to man-made issues, including pollution through waste and 
increasing carbon emissions as well as human rights violations, 
these spaces are increasingly endangered. This is where Sport 
needs a space comes in. It is our way to take on the challenges 
that pose a threat to the spaces of sport and, at the same time, 
our planet and people. 
",9
"We have identified six priorities to address 
the issues and challenges of the places 
where sport is made, where sport is sold, 
and where sport is played. In short: along 
our entire value chain. Cross-cutting and 
relevant for all spaces, these priorities 
have been translated into tangible and 
measurable goals we aim to achieve 
by 2020, specifically focusing on two 
dimensions: product (including materials, 
technologies or the manufacturing 
process) and people (our own employees 
as much as our factory workers, fans, 
athletes, and consumers). 
 page 0608
",9
"Covering our entire business model from 
end to end, Sport needs a space requires 
a holistic management approach. For 
this reason we have created an internal 
cross-functional governance structure, 
a tripartite organisation ranging from 
project owners to our strategic working 
group to a sponsor board. The structures 
ultimate ambition is manifold: on the one 
hand, it empowers bottom-up creativity 
and expertise as well as cross-functional 
 alignment and transparent decision-making. At 
the same time, it allows a very robust tracking of 
progress with clearly defined accountabilities. 
Most importantly, it also ensures that priorities 
stay relevant in the long run as well as flexible enough so they 
can be adjusted to changing internal and external developments 
if need be. 
",9
"The operational part of the structure is made up of the respec-
tive project owners on the ground who drive implementation 
and provide the necessary valuable feedback on the develop-
ment and execution of their projects to the strategic working 
group. Made up of nominated project leads and sustainability 
experts representing individual functions, this group not only 
monitors the progress of Sport needs a space, they also iden-
tify and react to trends and stakeholder expectations in order 
to fine-tune and advance the cross-functional programme in 
monthly meetings. They further 
define and align KPIs and targets for 
Sport needs a space, ensure effi-
cient decision-making, and in turn 
report their findings to the sponsor 
board consisting of senior represent-
atives of our company  from Social & 
Environmental Affairs (SEA), Global 
Operations, Global Brands, Human 
Resources, Global Workplaces, Retail 
Concept, Sales, Finance, and Com-
munication. Acting as advocates, they 
promote the strategy to the Execu-
tive Board and top management to 
ensure its activation and endorse-
ment throughout the company. They 
also oversee the progress made 
towards our 2020 goals as one team 
and provide strategic framework and 
priorities for possible adjustments, 
further developments, and commu-
nication of Sport needs a space.

"While the foundation for a success-
ful structure has been laid in 2016, 
we will continue to fine-tune the pro-
gramme based on learnings in 2017 
and beyond.

"We are a globally operating com-
pany with a lot of resources and 
knowledge based on a long his-
tory of sustainable engagement 
that we are very proud of. As an 
important part of this, we recog-
nise our responsibility to respect 
human rights and the importance 
of showing that we are taking the 
necessary steps to fulfil this social 
obligation as a business. We do this 
by striving to operate responsibly along the entire value 
chain, safeguarding the rights of our own employees 
and those of our suppliers through our Workplace 
Standards, and applying our influence to affect change 
wherever human rights issues are linked to our busi-
ness activities. But we are well aware that we can have 
a bigger impact when working with partners. 
",10
"Since its inception in 1997, our human and labour 
rights programme has been built on the back of 
intense stakeholder outreach and engagement: seek-
ing to understand and define the most salient issues 
to address as a company, to learn from them and 
use that knowledge to support our overall mission 
to change lives through sport. This has become visi-
ble once more through our human rights activities in 
2016 that were based on the heightened outreach to 
and engagement with our stakeholder groups as well 
as the development and publication of new industry 
benchmarks.
",10
"In October 2016, in line with our long standing com-
mitment to addressing the human rights challenges 
 related to sports, as laid out in our Sports 
needs a space strategy, we actively con-
tributed to a series of white papers which 
were presented at a multi-stakeholder 
Sporting Chance Forum in Washington DC. 
The two-day event promoted the learning 
and capacity building of the parties involved 
in major sporting events. It also explored 
ways to develop more comprehensive, 
consistent, and inclusive approaches 
to managing human rights impacts. We 
believe that only by pooling the knowledge 
of sponsors, sports bodies, governments, 
and advocacy groups it is possible to high-
light and devise more effective strategies 
to address the human rights challenges 
associated with mega-sporting events, 
from planning through to legacy.
",10
"Throughout 2016, we invested time in pre-
paring and sharing updates on our human 
rights policies and practices, including 
the disclosure of our Approach to Human 
Rights Defenders. We understand that we 
are the only business globally to have pub-
lished such a policy. In addition, we shared 
our experience on the role business can play 
in protecting human rights defenders with 
members of the UN Global Compact.
",10
"An important validation of our efforts comes 
from the newly launched Corporate Human 
Rights Benchmark (CHRB), which rates the 
top 500 globally listed companies on their 
human rights policy, process, and performance. We are proud 
to have been selected for the pilot and ranked second in the 
Apparel sector, and fifth in the overall ranking out of 98 cor-
porations in total. We will be using the results of the bench-
mark to identify gaps and areas for improvement in our human 
rights work.
",10
"Also released in 2016 was the KnowTheChain evaluation of 
forced labour in the global Apparel and Footwear sector. Among 
the twenty companies selected for evaluation, we ranked first in 
the sector due to our best practices, including strong disclosure 
and supply chain risk mapping. The result was also based on 
our Modern Slavery Outreach Programme, launched earlier in 
the year, as well as our published call to non-profit groups and 
other companies to join us in tackling modern slavery issues 
in high-risk countries. 
",10
"As a global sports company, we do have the obligation to lead 
by example. We will continue to reach out to and engage with 
the relevant stakeholder groups so we can intensify our sup-
port for human rights activities.

",10
"It is our mission to be the best sports company in the world. 
For us, this means creating long-term, sustainable value which 
goes far beyond the consideration of mere financial metrics: it 
includes the management of major intangible value drivers in 
our company such as our sustainability performance. 
",11
"In order to measure our sustainability per-
formance we know it is critical that we fully 
understand the environmental implications 
of doing business. In 2016, for the very first 
time, we conducted a fact-based pilot analysis 
to assess our organisational environmental 
footprint. The aim was to better understand 
where our main environmental impacts occur 
along our value chain, and to translate them 
into monetary terms. The results of the anal-
ysis will contribute to our Integrated Perfor-
mance Management (IPM) programme, which 
is our overall strategic approach to system-
atically and consistently consider major 
tangible and intangible value drivers in the 
 decision-making of our company. 
",11
"Major impacts identified in indirect 
 supply chain
",11
"The objective of our environmental footprint 
analysis was to provide us with a clear pic-
ture of what our main environmental impacts 
along our value chain are and how they cor-
relate to each other in terms of magnitude. 
For our pilot exercise we used an interna-
tionally recognised methodology to analyse 
 our entire value chain from process-
ing of raw materials (Tier 3), upstream 
supply chain (Tier 2), direct suppli-
ers (Tier 1) to indirect spends, logis-
tics, core operations including our own 
offices and own retail, all the way to the 
use phase and end-of-life of our prod-
ucts. The analysis was conducted in 
three steps: firstly, we collected rel-
evant primary data from own systems 
and operations, as well as secondary 
data to complete potential data gaps. 
Secondly, we calculated our environ-
mental impacts in absolute terms that 
were translated into monetary value in 
a last step.
",11
"Using the baseline of 2015, we focused 
on five main environmental impacts: 
GHG (Greenhouse Gas) emissions, water 
consumption, land use as well as air 
and water pollution. Results show that 
only 4% of our impacts relate to our core 
operations (operations related to all of

" 
WHILE MAXIMISING THE  
VALUE OF OUR BUSINESS
 our administration offices, distribution centres and own pro-
duction sites globally, as well as own retail stores globally). 
The biggest impact however happens in the upstream supply 
chain in factories beyond our Tier 1 suppliers we have a direct 
relationship with. 
",11
"  GHG emissions account for 42% of our total environmental 
impacts, with more than half of these CO emissions (54%) 
caused beyond our direct suppliers. The impacts occur dur-
ing the processing of raw materials, e.g. leather produc-
tion, which is mainly due to cattle farming, as well as high 
energy use for production of synthetic materials.
",11
"  Air pollution comes second with 31% of our total impacts. 
The main reasons can be found in the energy-intensive pro-
cess for synthetic material production and burning of fossil 
fuels for energy production. 
",11
"  Water consumption makes up 15% of our total impacts, with 
indirect suppliers being the main contributor. Raw material 
production across Tier 3 suppliers accounts for 68% of our 
overall water consumption, which is mainly related to agri-
cultural processes. Tier 2 suppliers account for further 21% 
of our water consumption, which is mainly the result of  dyeing 
and other wet processes necessary for manufacturing our 
products.
",11
"Results drive holistic company 
performance measurement
",12
"We will repeat this footprint anal-
ysis regularly and use the insights 
we gained to evaluate the effective-
ness of the programmes we already 
have in place, to select the most 
effective future strategies to reduce 
our impacts, to monitor our pro-
gress against the targets laid out 
in our sustainability strategy and 
to further fine tune our approach if 
necessary.
",12
"In addition, we will continue to work 
on enhancing the footprint meth-
odology used as well as integrat-
ing our findings into the relevant 
business processes. Therefore, the 
results are a crucial contribution to 
drive our IPM ambition. This is our 
way to embed material financial 
and non-financial, as well as tan-
gible and non-tangible value-driv-
ing aspects of our business model, 
systematically into our decision 
making. Providing increased trans-

"To remember where we have been 
and where we need to get to! I am 
committed to do everything in 
my power to ensure our suppliers 
are doing everything within their 
power  this means encouraging 
 them to invest in the best equipment 
they can afford and adopting industry 
best practice  in order for them to 
 achieve their full potential.

"Water is not only essential for life, it is 
also a key resource for our industry. With 
the ever-growing issue of water scarcity, 
we have developed an overall approach 
to address water efficiency, improve 
wastewater quality, and provide better 
accessibility to water in communities. We 
know that we can only be successful if all 
of our partners along the supply chain 
contribute to our ambition. Educating our 
suppliers, subcontractors and material 
suppliers, making them identify and 
report their water footprint, and acting 
upon these results is a top priority of our Sustainability Strategy. 
For this reason we have put several programmes and procedures 
in place to support our apparel and footwear suppliers. 
",16
"As part of the Manufacturing Excellence programme, one target 
is to achieve 50% water savings at apparel material suppliers 
by 2020. Introduced in 2013, the strategic initiative deep-dives 
into a variety of projects across  adidas supply base to further 
optimise how our products are engineered and manufactured. 
As our industry uses high volumes of water at the stage of 
raw material processing, we collaborate closely with our 
apparel supplier base by educating them about best available 
technologies and processes to strengthen their capabilities 
as well as to improve water usage in the manufacturing of our 
products. This includes training and advising both our internal 
colleagues and our suppliers on innovative methodologies and 
technology options that are needed to save water. Over the past 
36 months, we have successfully promoted several procedures 
tackling those areas considered critical in water processing and 
usage in textile production, all of them resulting in increased 
water efficiency. 
",16
"One of these procedures is Right First Time. As any per-
centage of failure during the dyeing process doubles or 
 triples the quantity of water required to dye a fixed quantity 
",16
"PRODUCT
 of material in the correct colour, Right First Time is crucial 
because it ensures that only one single dyeing process and the 
standard water consumption is necessary to get it right. Addi-
tional work streams include water recycling  the most com-
mon technology used  which aims for 100% reuse of water or 
zero discharge as well as improved materiality which again 
saves 1% total water usage for every 1% in material qual-
ity gained. We further implemented machinery upgrades to 
improve liquor ratio processes and promoted higher capac-
ity utilisation to increase the amount of material processed 
in production machines. First results of these upgrades and 
investments are already visible: since 2014 we have reduced 
the amount of water in our materials processes from 121 
litres/kg to 95 litres/kg  a reduction of 22%. 
",16
"Based on this success, we have begun to apply a similar 
approach to achieve water savings at our footwear suppliers. 
In 2016, we started a pilot project with four factories. The goal 
is to motivate them to track their water consumption data to 
make sure we fully understand their water usage. As a second 
step we can then find ways to strengthen their capability to save 
water in their manufacturing processes. 
",17
"We also continue to be transparent about our suppliers 
discharge of waste water. As of 2016, 80% of all wet processes 
across our global supply chain were publicly disclosed. Our 
efforts to improve our suppliers environmental performance 
were again officially recognised. In 2016, for the second 
consecutive year, adidas ranked first in the textile sector and 
second overall out of 198 companies across industries as 
evaluated in the Corporate Information Transparency Index 
(CITI). Created by the Institute of Public & Environmental Affairs 
(IPE) in close cooperation with the US-based environmental 
NGO, the Natural Resources Defence Council (NRDC), the index 
rates the performance of international brands in managing 
environmental impacts of manufacturing operations in China 
and identifies environmental issues within their supply chain. 
In addition to being first in textiles and second overall, adidas 
is listed in the CITI Top 30, officially testifying that we as a 
company are making earnest steps towards green procurement 
and that the environmental performance of our supply chain in 
China is considered a leading effort worldwide.
",17
"These results are not down to chance. In fact, we have been 
collaborating with the IPE since 2011. Once notified by them, we 
partnered with our suppliers to work on their environmental 
violations until they were fully addressed. We also conducted 
monthly screenings of our suppliers presence in the IPE 
database. We are aware that further improving our CITI 
rating in 2017 will be a challenge due to, for example, stricter 
environmental legislation and increasing costs for more 
frequent monitoring of our suppliers performance. However, 
we will continue our path towards a green supply chain in 
China.

"Water is a renewable resource, but factors such 
as the ever-growing population and the impacts 
of climate change are tipping the scale to a point 
where water supply may no longer meet demand. 
Water stress, defined as the ratio of total freshwater withdrawn to 
the total renewable fresh water resources, affects two billion people 
and every continent. This hinders environmental sustainability, 
economic growth and social development.

"We are driven by our ambition to achieve water stewardship. For us, 
this means knowing and reducing our own water use and improving 
our impact on water at our own operations and our value chain 
through innovative solutions and partnerships. 
",18
"While it is important to make sure that our suppliers improve 
their water footprint, it is equally if not more important that our 
own operations lead by example. In 2016, Green Company, our 
environmental programme for our own sites globally, presented 
its 2020 targets for water designed to continue our leadership in 
water use reductions. 
 see page 20 for details
",18
"The second generation of our Green Company programme sets 
context-based water reduction targets which are based on one 
important understanding: water is a local resource, and reductions 
in water use can only be achieved if 
addressed individually in each of the 
locations. To define the most efficient 
targets for each of our sites globally we 
assess the local challenges by taking 
local watersheds into account using the 
Aqueduct Water Risk Atlas. As a result, 
we have set proportionally higher targets 
in water critical-areas.

"In 2016, our efforts were recognised by 
the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) 
with a good B score (A being the best), 
following our response to their water 
questionnaire. With our own Green 
Company programme we will continue to 
lead by example in order to reduce water 
use at our own sites around the world.

"The availability of clean water is 
essential for humans and the planet to 
survive. We are very proud to look back 
on a long-standing history of supporting 
those in need through engaging in 
partnerships for certain projects in 
order to help communities. One of these 
partners is SOS Childrens Villages. 
Most recently, we teamed up on a water 
project in Aleppo, Syria, that resulted in 
700 families having access to water on 
a daily basis.

"SOS Childrens Villages Syria is pro-
viding water to buildings connected 
to a borehole through fixed pipes as 
well as public water taps while also 
transporting fresh water from the wells 
to surrounding neighbourhoods. In 
addition, SOS Childrens Villages gave the 
local authorities in and around Aleppo a 
new water pump that can provide up to 
30,000 people with fresh water. The team 
also installed ten metal containers in the 
centre of Aleppo to provide 5,000 people

our new Sustainability Strategy in 2016, we took the 
opportunity to enhance our existing tools to measure 
our suppliers environmental performance, which has 
led us to the development of a more refined method of

We achieved a 23% reduction in water use per employee 
between 2008 and 2016, despite increased water 
consumption in 2016. This was the result of improvements 
in irrigation efficiency, especially at campus locations with 
on-site football fields and golf courses. Other measures 
include the installation of water-saving devices and the 
introduction of awareness campaigns for employees. 
A few sites are still unable to measure their water 
consumption accurately as they share their office building 
with other occupants. The water charges for their leased 
or rented space are usually not metered separately, which 
makes it difficult to measure water volume in this type of 
shared-occupancy setting.

towards the marine environment, the 
most important yet most fragile ecosys-
tem on our planet. As founding member, 
we support Parley for the Oceans in its 
efforts in communication and education, 
research and develop ment, direct action 
and eco- innovation. The mutual focus is 
on Parleys comprehensive Ocean Plastic 
Program, which is led by the Parley A.I.R. 
Strategy (Avoid, Intercept, and Redesign) 
to end ocean plastic pollution.

"As part of this, we are working closely 
with Parley to transform marine plastic 
pollution into performance sports gear. 
The plan is working out and, in Novem-
ber 2016, experienced a highlight with 
the introduction of our first commercial 
football and running performance prod-
ucts made with Parley Ocean  Plastic: the 
unique Bayern Munich and Real Madrid

Uncaged were the first products for con-
sumers to purchase. The partnership will 
continue in 2017 with the goal of creat-
ing one million pairs of shoes made with 
 Parley Ocean Plastic. 
",24
"While we work with Parley to reuse plastic 
waste, we are also focusing on altogether 
avoiding the production of new plastic. 
One of the solutions we are currently look-
ing into is Sport Infinity, a research project 
led by  adidas and funded by the European 
Commission, which aims to identify and 
develop innovative recyclable composites 
that can be broken down into 3D-shape-
able materials, and then remoulded in 
a waste-free process into a brand new 
product. In 2016, an initial proof of concept 
underlined for us that this is the most effi-
cient and sustainable manufacturing pro-
cess for recyclable products, with the key 
benefits being a drastic reduction in waste 
and the ability to create a product without 
the use of adhesives. We have also worked 
on a first range of qualified materials en- 
abling fully recyclable products. As a 
result we were able to build first demon-
strators made from these materials.

"The latest sustainable innovation is the Futurecraft Biofabric pro-
totype, which we presented in November 2016. The worlds first 
performance shoe made from Biosteel fibres, developed by the 
German biotech company AMSilk, not only provides all the prop-
erties of a highly functioning performance shoe, it is also 100% 
biodegradable in a fully natural process. We will continue our 
work on this research project over the coming years. 
",24
"These examples are complemented by our overall approach and 
successful efforts to use more sustainable materials in our prod-
ucts, for example the ever-growing amount of Better Cotton used 
in our global production. As a founding member and participating 
company, we have been partnering with the Better Cotton Initi-
ative (BCI) since 2004, supporting the environmental and social 
benefits the initiative brings with it. In 2016, 68% of the cotton we 
sourced globally was Better Cotton, again exceeding our original 
target of 60%. This brings us even closer 
to achieving our commitment to source 
100% of cotton across all product cate-
gories in all our brands as sustainable 
cotton by 2018.

CHEMICAL FOOTPRINT
 example by involving our licensees and subsidiaries. By the 
end of 2016, we had approved solutions for roughly 96% of all 
released products. As there are no global standards to define 
PFC-free, we have created and implemented an  adidas PFC-
free policy which summarises the most up-to-date findings of 
our research work and describes a sophisticated procedure to 
ensure compliance with our PFC-free programme as well as to 
eliminate the intentional use of PFCs. The policy covers the full 
supply chain, end to end: from input chemistry to production 
through to the final product, and further provides an approved 
list of formulations to be used by all  adidas suppliers as well 
as an approved list of suppliers who meet our requirements to 
produce PFC-free products. All these steps and achievements, 
continuous research and commitment have put us in a strong 
position towards achieving our ambition as of 2018 onwards. 
",25
"We strive to be open about our progress even if we do not 
have all the answers yet. While we are well on the way to 
eliminating PFCs from our production processes, we have 
started working on reducing the negative impacts of pro-
cessing a new chemical of concern: DMF 2, a hazardous sol-
vent used to manufacture synthetic leather products. We are 
currently evaluating how many water-based materials are 
finding their way into our new products and will proactively 
promote these internally to raise awareness. As an impor-
tant next step, we will collaborate with chemical suppliers and 
PU 3 production facilities to optimise the performance prop-
erties of synthetic leather products that are currently not 
water-based to find the perfect balance between creating the 
best for the athlete and optimising our environmental impact.

in our teams and strengthening our research 
capacities to find PFC-free alternatives that meet 
our high performance and quality standards in 
recent years, we have already succeeded in being 
90% PFC-free since June 2014, and have eliminated 
all long-chain (i.e. C7, C8 and longer) PFCs since 
January 2015, across all products we produce or

track individual waste streams and volumes. Currently, 
45% of all our sites have implemented a tracking system. 
Some of these challenges relate to how our leases are 
structured. For example, we may be charged a flat waste-

"Within the eKPI 2.0 tool, we developed 
three supplier benchmark groups for 
each category (apparel, footwear, and

gender and age targets for their functional areas by taking 
criteria such as business growth, attrition, promotions, 
and hirings into consideration. We successfully hired a

our global diversity strategy. In addition to regular events 
highlighting diversity as a key topic, we provide diversity 
and gender intelligence trainings to our employees. In 2016, 
we piloted the BIG Deal training project (BIG stands for 
balanced, inclusive, and gender intelligent), a newly designed 
gender intelligence training that provides leaders with data, 
insights, and tools for an inclusive leadership in order to 
build a balanced organisation. BIG Deal will be offered on 
a global scale going forward. For the second consecutive

to the limited number of suppliers in Tur-
key and our strict enforcement approach 
that stipulates that refugees or migrants 
cannot be offered employment without 
a work permit, we have not identified 
any Syrian refugee in our supply chain in 
Turkey. Nonetheless, we are sensitive to 
the broader humanitarian issue facing 
the Syrian refugees and have engaged 
closely with brands sourcing from Tur-
key, local trade unions, NGOs, and the

in collaboration with the United Nations 
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)

key articles of Turkish labour law, such as 
minimum wage, working hours, compen-
sation, leave, and other rights and bene-
fits  which has the potential of decreasing

quite consistent in each region, there were also country-specific 
cases. SEA conducted several additional audits in Brazil in 2015 
in support of government investigations into working conditions,

components for a finished product. While we include these types 
of suppliers in our database to achieve greater visibility of our

activities. Consequently, audit coverage would be higher if 
only high-risk countries were taken into consideration. Higher 
performing suppliers (those which have demonstrated robust

which is rewarded with a reduced frequency in external audits.

"Our suppliers are evaluated against a number of critical 
compliance issues. While zero tolerance issues  such as 
forced labour practices  immediately disqualify a factory 
from further consideration, threshold issues trigger rejection 
at new factories, but can be addressed in a specified timeframe 
at existing factories. 
",69
"The charts in this section illustrate these non-compliance 
findings that were identified during the pre-screening of 
suppliers in initial assessments and initial assessment 
follow-up visits conducted at prospective new factories in 
2016. A supplier must resolve identified issues before it can 
be accepted into the  adidas supply chain.
",69
"The first chart presents the labour-related non-compliances 
identified in supplier factories. More than two thirds of the 
labour-related findings fall into the top three broad categories: 
Wages, Benefits, and Working Hours/Overtime. Wages 
covers  among other things  policies and practices in the 
factory for the timely and full payment of wages, overtime 
payments, and deductions. Benefits relates mainly to policies 
and practices for benefits, social and medical insurances, 
leave, and public holidays. Working hours/Overtime covers 
management systems for working hours, policies and practices, 
excessive working hours, regular and overtime working hours 
as well as rest days.
",69
"Besides identifying non-compliances with our Workplace 
Standards at factories,  adidas compliance team focuses on 
the existence and implementation of management systems on 
the suppliers side. The team identifies any gaps in policies and 
procedures related to specific areas such as forced labour, child 
labour, freedom of association, or discrimination. As a result, 
the percentages shown indicate the systemic shortcomings of 
newly proposed suppliers rather than the confirmed presence of 
specific non-compliances, such as child labour (see footnote 3).

"The second chart shows the health & safety non-compliances 
identified during the pre-screening of new supplier factories. 
Fire and electrical safety are critical areas for any potential new 
supplier and together accounted for 21% of the non-compliances 
identified in 2016. The way chemicals were stored and used, 
including the presence of banned chemicals, accounted for 15% 
of non-conformances reported. A further 14% of the findings

on their ability to deliver fair, healthy, and environmentally 
sound workplace conditions.

"Social Compliance Rating (C-KPI)
The following table shows the average assessment score by 
unit of measure for active suppliers. Each unit of measure is 
scored out of 100%. Compared to 2015, the average score of 
all C-KPI units of measure, except for worker-management 
communication and industrial relations, decreased in 2016. 
This reflects the efforts by the newly created Monitoring team 
in Asia who conducted more frequent and more in-depth KPI 
assessments, which triggers corresponding remedial action and 
support by a dedicated Advisory team.
",70
"Generally, newly assessed factories start with a relatively low 
KPI score (typically 2C) and over a period of years they build 
and improve their management systems and compliance 
performance. The presence of repetitive or serious threshold 
issues can however trigger even lower performance. This is 
reflected, for example, in those suppliers receiving a 1C score, 
which means they are at risk of termination.
",70
"The bar graph below shows comparable data for the past three 
years using this rating classification. 
",70
"In 2016, the number of 1C category suppliers, which represent the 
lowest performing factories with serious issues and very weak 
commitment to compliance, remained at 1% of the KPI-assessed 
factories. Such factories are given a one-year grace period to 
move up a grade or have their services terminated. Since 2013, 
there has been a focused effort to improve the 2C factories, 
which led to a 11% reduction of suppliers in this category. 
",70
"67% of our direct suppliers had ratings of 3C or better, which 
represents an increase of 3% compared to 2014, although it 
has fallen marginally by 2% compared to last year. For the 4C 
factories, we see a 7% decline (23% vs 16%) in the number of 
suppliers in this self-governance rating classification. The main 
reason for this is that some factories struggled to maintain their 
high performance due to turnover in their in-house compliance 
teams and the more robust and in-depth KPI assessments 
being conducted by SEA, including an increased frequency of 
unannounced audits.
",70
"It is worth noting that the number of factories that are subject 
to C-KPI ratings has remained relatively stable at around 45% of 
the global supply chain for the last three years. These factories

"The Green Company initiative has been the driver for successfully 
implementing tools that help us to continuously reduce the 
environmental impacts of our corporate sites. One of them is our 
Integrated Management System (IMS). In 2016, we expanded our 
scope to a fully integrated system. Bringing three management 
systems under one roof (ISO 14001, ISO 50001 and BS OHSAS 
18001), the Integrated Management System (IMS) allows us 
to manage initiatives related to environment, energy, and 
occupational health & safety in a single system. 
",79
"By defining clear procedures and responsibilities that promote 
efficient and eco-friendly operations, IMS enables us to improve 
our risk management and accident prevention to create a safer 
work environment.

2  Restatement: Due to double counts caused by the data tracking systems, the 2014 donation requests received for the EMEA region had to be corrected.
",83
"In 2016, we saw a decrease in donation requests compared to 
the previous two years. One of the reasons is that we reworked 
our guidance for external requests to provide even greater clarity 
on our corporate giving scope. In general, donation or funding 
requests significantly varied in nature and purpose. Incoming 
requests were carefully reviewed against the  adidas Corporate 
Giving Guidelines to ensure alignment with corporate policies, 
procedures, and the available budget framework. 
",83
"Compared to 2015, the number of supported projects decreased, 
which reflects our more stringent approach in conducting needs 
assessments with clear internal definitions. This helped us to 
continuously focus on key projects with fewer but more impactful 
organisations. 
",83
"The amount of product donations increased, especially in region 
EMEA. There we targeted major volumes of product donations 
 to support people in severe need, such as refugees at the 
Turkish-Syrian border as well as in various refugee camps all 
over Europe. To effectively respond to the refugee crisis, adidas 
continued its financial support in order to ensure sustainable 
and purposeful assistance. 
",83
"Compared to previous years, we saw a slight decrease in volunteer 
hours across our global workforce, but again an increase in 
volunteer hours among employees in region EMEA. This is the 
result of continuous employee involvement, in particular in the 
context of refugee support.
",83
"With our data tracking system, we aim to fully cover activities 
from all subsidiaries worldwide. We are constantly reviewing our 
approach and the system to improve data quality.
