This project examines how NLP techniques can be used to help analyze Sustainability Reports.
The reports used are sustainability reports from DAX companies, and the framework studied is ESRS.
We hope to contribute to helping write and analyze reports for the upcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.
