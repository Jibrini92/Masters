Master thesis project 

This project examines how NLP techniques can be used to help analyze Sustainability Reports.
The reports used are sustainability reports from DAX companies, and the framework studied is ESRS.
We hope to contribute to helping write and analyze reports for the upcoming Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive.
# Recommended reading order
For easiest comprehension, it is recommended to read this directory backward.
Start with level-3 labeling, as it shows the complete pipeline. Move on to fine-tuning and training data selection to understand the two-level classifier. Centroid, ada_002, and well formness provide more context for the data selection. Finally, text extraction and analysis to understand the raw data.
